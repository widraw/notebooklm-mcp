# NotebookLM REST API + MCP server

**Automate Google NotebookLM at scale. 33-endpoint HTTP REST API for n8n / Zapier / Make / curl, plus an MCP server for Claude Code / Cursor / Codex. Citation-backed Q&A, full Studio generation (audio · video · infographic · report · presentation · data table), multi-account rotation with auto-reauth.**

> v1.7.1 — production-grade, batch-tested on overnight runs of 1 000+ questions. New: `batch_to_vault` is now a first-class MCP tool (no HTTP server required) on top of the existing `POST /batch-to-vault` endpoint. See [RTFM integration](./deployment/docs/14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md) for the full pattern. [Compare with `PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp` v2.0.0](https://roomi-fields.github.io/notebooklm-mcp/compare) to see when this project is the right pick (REST API, full Studio, auto-reauth) and when the MCP-only upstream is.

## Features

### Q&A with Citations

- **Ask questions** to NotebookLM and get accurate, citation-backed answers
- **Source citation extraction** with 5 formats: none, inline, footnotes, json, expanded (97% excerpt success rate)
- **Session management** for multi-turn conversations with auto-reauth on session expiry

### Content Generation

Generate multiple content types from your notebook sources:

| Content Type       | Formats                  | Options                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Audio Overview** | Podcast-style discussion | Language (80+), custom instructions            |
| **Video**          | Brief, Explainer         | 6 visual styles, language, custom instructions |
| **Infographic**    | Horizontal, Vertical     | Language, custom instructions                  |
| **Report**         | Summary, Detailed        | Language, custom instructions                  |
| **Presentation**   | Overview, Detailed       | Language, custom instructions                  |
| **Data Table**     | Simple, Detailed         | Language, custom instructions                  |

**Video Visual Styles**: classroom, documentary, animated, corporate, cinematic, minimalist

### Content Download

- **Download Audio** — WAV audio files
- **Download Video** — MP4 video files
- **Download Infographic** — PNG image files
- Text-based content (report, presentation, data_table) is returned in the API response

### Source Management

- **Add sources**: Files (PDF, TXT, DOCX), URLs, Text, YouTube videos, Google Drive
- **List sources**: View all sources in a notebook

### Notebook Library

- **Multi-notebook management** with validation and smart selection
- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically generate metadata via NotebookLM queries
- **Search notebooks** by keyword in name, description, or topics
- **Scrape notebooks**: List all notebooks from NotebookLM with IDs and names
- **Bulk delete**: Delete multiple notebooks at once

### Integration Options

- **MCP Protocol** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, any MCP client
- **HTTP REST API** — n8n, Zapier, Make.com, custom integrations
- **Docker** — Isolated deployment with Docker or Docker Compose
- **[RTFM](https://github.com/roomi-fields/rtfm) retrieval layer** — `/batch-to-vault` writes citation-backed answers as markdown + JSON sidecars (`nblm-answer-v1` schema), indexable by [RTFM](https://github.com/roomi-fields/rtfm) (FTS5 + semantic) for unlimited offline queries. Ideal for academic / SOTA workflows. [Guide](./deployment/docs/14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md).

## Quick Start

### Option 0 — Claude Code marketplace (one-liner, recommended for Claude Code users)

The fastest way to get NotebookLM into Claude Code. Distributed via the [`roomi-fields/claude-plugins`](https://github.com/roomi-fields/claude-plugins) marketplace alongside [RTFM](https://github.com/roomi-fields/rtfm) (the retrieval companion — see [RTFM integration guide](./deployment/docs/14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md)):

```text
/plugin marketplace add roomi-fields/claude-plugins
/plugin install notebooklm@roomi-fields
```

That registers the MCP server, runs `npx -y @roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp` automatically on first use (Node ≥ 18 required), and keeps you in sync with releases via `/plugin update`. Then run `npm run setup-auth` once to log into Google. To install RTFM at the same time: `/plugin install rtfm@roomi-fields`.

### Option 1 — HTTP REST API (n8n, Zapier, Make, curl, any HTTP client)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp.git
cd notebooklm-mcp
npm install && npm run build
npm run setup-auth   # One-time Google login
npm run start:http   # Start REST API on port 3000
```

```bash
# Citation-backed Q&A, single curl, JSON response
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ask \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"question": "Summarize chapter 3", "notebook_id": "your-id", "source_format": "json"}'
```

The full surface is **33 documented endpoints** — see the [REST API reference](https://roomi-fields.github.io/notebooklm-mcp/notebooklm-rest-api). For overnight batches of 1 000+ questions, see the [batch pattern](https://roomi-fields.github.io/notebooklm-mcp/batch-1000-questions).

### Option 2 — MCP Mode (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex)

```bash
# Build (same package, MCP transport)
git clone https://github.com/roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp.git
cd notebooklm-mcp
npm install && npm run build

# Claude Code
claude mcp add notebooklm node /path/to/notebooklm-mcp/dist/index.js

# Cursor — add to ~/.cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/notebooklm-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then say: _"Log me in to NotebookLM"_ → Chrome opens → log in with Google.

### Option 3 — Docker (NAS, server, headless)

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t notebooklm-mcp .
docker run -d --name notebooklm-mcp -p 3000:3000 -p 6080:6080 -v notebooklm-data:/data notebooklm-mcp

# Authenticate via noVNC
# 1. Open http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
# 2. Run: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/setup-auth -d '{"show_browser":true}'
# 3. Login to Google in the VNC window
```

See [Docker Guide](./deployment/docs/08-DOCKER.md) for NAS deployment (Synology, QNAP).

- **v1.5.9** — Restore `mcpName` field for MCP Registry npm-package ownership verification
- **v1.5.8** — NotebookLM 2026 UI adaptations (icon-label sanitization, Discussion-panel recovery, count-based source detection) — PR #5 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal
- **v1.5.7** — Citation extraction selector fix (`.highlighted`) and Docker multi-stage build — PR #1 by @JulienCANTONI
- **v1.5.6** — Citation extraction major rewrite (97% success rate), browser-verified auth at startup, profile auto-sync
- **v1.5.5** — Multi-account state-path bug fix, Windows startup scripts, hidden-window MCP proxy
- **v1.5.4** — Mid-session auto-reauth with stored credentials, TOTP support
- **v1.5.3** — Docker deployment with noVNC for visual authentication + NAS support (Synology, QNAP)
- **v1.5.2** — Notebook scraping from NotebookLM + Bulk delete + Bug fixes
- **v1.5.1** — Multilingual UI support (FR/EN) with i18n selector system + E2E tests (76 tests)
- **v1.5.0** — Complete Studio content generation (video, infographic, presentation, data_table) + Notes management + Delete sources
- **v1.4.0** — Content management (sources, audio, generation) + Multi-account

**Not yet implemented:**

- Discover sources (Web/Drive search with Fast/Deep modes)
- Edit notes (create, delete, and convert are implemented)

**About browser automation:**
While I've built in humanization features (realistic typing speeds, natural delays, mouse movements), I can't guarantee Google won't detect or flag automated usage. Use a dedicated Google account for automation.

**About CLI tools and AI agents:**
CLI tools like Claude Code, Codex, and similar AI-powered assistants are powerful but can make mistakes:

- Always review changes before committing or deploying
- Test in safe environments first
- Keep backups of important work
- AI agents are assistants, not infallible oracles

I built this tool for myself and share it hoping it helps others, but I can't take responsibility for any issues that might occur. Use at your own discretion.
