## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed — new-answer detection could time out on a repeated answer text

`waitForLatestAnswer` (used by `notebook_ask` and every Studio content
generation flow) identified "the new answer" by hashing its text and
comparing against the texts captured before the question was submitted.
If NotebookLM answered the new question with the exact same text as an
earlier answer in the same notebook (e.g. two questions both answered
"Yes", or repeated short/deterministic test prompts), the new answer's
hash collided with an already-known one and was skipped as "seen" —
the wait then timed out after the full 5-minute budget despite the
answer being stable and visible in the page.

Fixed by identifying the new answer via DOM position instead: NotebookLM
adds exactly one new `.to-user-container` per submitted question, so
"any container added after a pre-submission baseline count" is immune
to text collisions. New `countAnswerContainers()` helper in
`page-utils.ts`; the position baseline is threaded through
`notebook_ask`, `content_generate`'s chat-fallback path, and the audio
overview chat-fallback path. Falls back to the previous hash-based
comparison when no baseline is supplied (unchanged behavior for that
case). 4 new regression tests reproduce the exact hash-collision
scenario and assert the position-based path resolves it.

Root cause identified while reviewing a similar diagnosis in
[PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp#61](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp/pull/61)
— thanks to [@macho715](https://github.com/macho715) for the writeup;
this fix is our own implementation, adapted to this project's
architecture.

### Fixed — orphan process on stdio disconnect

The server only handled `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown. MCP
clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex, …) signal disconnect by
closing the stdio pipe, not by sending a signal — without a handler for
that, the process could stay alive as an orphan with its browser session
still open. Now also shuts down on stdin `end`/`close`. Inspired by
[PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp#47](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp/pull/47)
(credit: [@altristech2025](https://github.com/altristech2025)).

### Added — Japanese UI locale

New `src/i18n/ja.json`, registered alongside fr/en/de. Best-effort
translations, not runtime-validated against a live Japanese NotebookLM
account — open an issue if any string is off. Inspired by
[PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp#51](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp/pull/51)
(credit: [@toshieji](https://github.com/toshieji)), reimplemented against
this project's i18n system rather than ported directly (different
codebase architecture).

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added — Thai locale selectors for `notebook_create` (#18, partial)

Added Thai text/`aria-label` selectors (`สร้าง`, `สร้างใหม่`, `สร้างโน้ตบุ๊ก`) to the
"Create notebook" button detection, contributed by
[@nontakiat](https://github.com/nontakiat). Without this, notebook creation
failed on Thai-language NotebookLM accounts, the same class of issue German
hit in [2.0.4].

Only the selector addition from #18 is included in this release. The PR's
second change — treating a NotebookLM notebook-redirect during text-source
upload as success — was not merged: it reports `success: true` even though
the source lands in the wrong (auto-created) notebook, not the one the
caller asked for. See the PR discussion for details.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added — `note_list` and `note_get` MCP tools (#17)

Two new Studio-panel tools, contributed by [@he0xwhale](https://github.com/he0xwhale):

- `note_list` (legacy alias `list_notes`) — scrolls the Studio panel to
  trigger lazy-load of older notes, then scrapes the note cards. Returns
  `{ id?, title, details? }` per note (timestamp lives in `details`).
- `note_get` (legacy alias `get_note`) — opens a note by title (or ID)
  and serializes its DOM to markdown. Includes a structural walker over
  `element-list-renderer` that preserves tables (with header row),
  ordered/unordered lists, headings, code blocks, and inline
  bold/italic/code/link spans. Falls back to the ProseMirror editor and
  then to the legacy text-only extractor if the structural walker comes
  back empty.

Both tools are exposed over HTTP at `POST /content/notes/list` and
`POST /content/notes/get`. Selectors use the durable
`artifact-library-note` + `artifact-title` pattern, consistent with the
id-pattern convention used elsewhere in the scraper.

Minor release: additive only, no behavioural change to any existing tool.

---

## [2.0.4] - 2026-06-20

### Added — German UI selectors (closes #14 deferred item)

The selector pipeline used to iterate only `fr` + `en`, so NotebookLM
accounts running in German (any selector-based action — `add_source`,
`generate_content`, the Studio tab, the source-type chips) would silently
fall through and report "Could not find …" errors.

- New `src/i18n/de.json` with the full string set (tabs, buttons, source
  types, content types, status, errors, placeholders, content options).
- `'de'` registered as a `SupportedLocale` so `SelectorBuilder`, `tAll()`
  and every dialog/chip lookup now emit German variants alongside FR/EN.
- New `src/__tests__/i18n.test.ts` asserts every locale ships the same
  leaf-key shape as the EN reference — catches the "new locale missing a
  translation key" regression class.

The German strings are best-effort and not runtime-validated against a
live German NotebookLM account — open an issue / PR if any string is off
and we'll fix it in a patch.

---

## [2.0.3] - 2026-06-20

### Security — `vault.batch` path-traversal hardening (issue #15)

The `vault_batch` tool (and the equivalent `POST /batch-to-vault` HTTP
endpoint) previously passed the caller-supplied `vault_dir` straight to
`path.resolve()` + `fs.mkdir()`, with no containment check. A caller (or a
prompt-injected LLM driving the MCP) could therefore create directories and
write `.md` / `.json` files anywhere the server process can write.

The fix is opt-in to stay backward-compatible:

- **`NOTEBOOKLM_VAULT_ROOT` env var** — when set, every `vault_dir` is
  resolved relative to this root and the resolved path must stay inside
  `realpath(NOTEBOOKLM_VAULT_ROOT)`. Any attempt to escape via an absolute
  path or a `..` segment is rejected with a clear error.
- **`slug_prefix` is now sanitized** — path separators (`/`, `\`), `..`
  sequences and NUL bytes are stripped, and the prefix is capped at 64
  chars, so a caller can no longer smuggle path traversal through the
  filename component.

Existing users who do not set `NOTEBOOKLM_VAULT_ROOT` see no behaviour
change; the `slug_prefix` sanitization is always on but only strips bytes
that were never valid filename characters anyway.

### Fixed — CI security audit no longer fails on dev-only advisories

The `Security` job now runs `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=moderate`.
Vulnerabilities reported in the jest / babel toolchain (which never ship in
the published package) no longer turn the main branch red while letting
production-dep regressions through. Also bumps `hono` override to
`^4.12.25` to clear GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc (CORS wildcard with credentials)
and the related cluster of `hono` advisories.

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed — canonical tool names use `_` instead of `.`

The v2 canonical tool names were a dot-separated tree (`notebook.ask`,
`source.add`, …), but the MCP / Anthropic tool-name pattern is
`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$` — **dots are not allowed**. Claude Code silently
rewrote the dots, masking the problem, but Claude Desktop validates remote
tool definitions strictly and rejected the whole server with:

```
tools.<n>.FrontendRemoteMcpToolDefinition.name: String should match pattern '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$'
```

Every canonical name now uses `_` as the namespace separator: `notebook.ask`
→ `notebook_ask`, `source.add` → `source_add`, `vault.batch` → `vault_batch`,
and so on across all 9 namespaces. This is what Claude Code already displayed,
so its users see no change. The legacy flat names remain accepted as aliases,
and a regression test now asserts every advertised name matches the pattern.

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **`add_source` for URL sources** — the 2026 NotebookLM add-source dialog
  redesign broke URL uploads on three fronts: the "Websites" tile is now an
  Angular Material chip (`mat-chip` / `mat-mdc-chip`), the URL textarea ships
  `aria-label="Enter URLs"` instead of a `placeholder` containing "URL", and
  the verification path's `Escape` keypress was landing mid-ingest and
  canceling the add. The dialog also closes asynchronously now, so the
  baseline source count was being captured _after_ the new row already
  appeared and the count-based detection never tripped. Threading the
  pre-baseline count from `addSource()` and waiting for the dialog to settle
  before verification fixes the false-negative. (Reported by
  [@assistantthatskywalker](https://github.com/assistantthatskywalker) in
  [#14](https://github.com/roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp/issues/14).)
- **Answer wait timeout 2 min → 5 min** in `waitForLatestAnswer` — long
  NotebookLM answers with many citations regularly exceed 2 minutes and were
  timing out as false negatives. (Cherry-picked from
  [@LScelza-synapse](https://github.com/LScelza-synapse)'s fork.)
- **Spanish profile-lock locale detection** — added "Abriendo en una sesión
  existente" to the regex that triggers the singleton-profile fallback, so
  Spanish-locale Chrome installs no longer hard-fail on a locked profile.

### Security

- Override `brace-expansion@^5.0.6` (scoped to the `^5.0.0` range so the older
  `1.x` line in eslint deps is untouched) — fixes
  [GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2).
- Override `qs@^6.15.2` — fixes
  [GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26)
  in the express / body-parser transitive chain.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed — tool names are now a namespaced tree

Every tool was renamed from a flat `snake_case` list to a navigable
`namespace_action` tree (9 namespaces): `notebook_*`, `library_*`, `session_*`,
`source_*`, `content_*`, `note_*`, `auth_*`, `server_*`, `vault_*`. For
example `ask_question` → `notebook_ask`, `add_source` → `source_add`,
`list_sessions` → `session_list`, `get_health` → `server_health`,
`batch_to_vault` → `vault_batch`. `tools/list` now advertises only the
canonical names. This aligns with MCP naming best practice and is the reason
for the major version bump.

> Note: 2.0.0–2.0.1 shipped these names with a `.` separator
> (`notebook.ask`), which the MCP tool-name pattern forbids; 2.0.2 corrected
> the separator to `_`. See the [2.0.2] entry.

**Backward compatible — nothing breaks.** Both the stdio server and the HTTP
proxy still accept the legacy flat names as aliases: the dispatch layer
normalises any accepted name (canonical or legacy) before routing. Existing
scripts, Claude Code / Cursor / n8n configs, and batch jobs that hard-code the
old names keep working unchanged. New integrations should use the canonical
names — the legacy aliases are supported but no longer advertised.

The legacy ↔ canonical mapping lives in one place: `src/tools/tool-names.ts`.

### Added

- **MCP `annotations` on every tool** — accurate `readOnlyHint` /
  `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` / `title` per tool,
  from a central table in `src/tools/index.ts`.
- **MCP `outputSchema` on every tool** — the shared `{ success, data?, error? }`
  result envelope every handler returns. The stdio dispatch now also returns
  `structuredContent` matching that schema, not just text.
- `smithery.yaml` + `mcpb/` bundle source — the server is now published on the
  [Smithery registry](https://smithery.ai/servers/roomifields/notebooklm-mcp).

### Security

- Resolve two new transitive advisories pulled in via
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.26.0`: **`fast-uri ≤3.1.1`** (high — path
  traversal / host confusion, GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6, GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc) and
  **`hono ≤4.12.17`** (moderate — several, incl. cache cross-user leakage
  GHSA-p77w-8qqv-26rm). Added `overrides` for `fast-uri ^3.1.2` and
  `hono ^4.12.18`; `npm audit` reports `0 vulnerabilities`.

---

## [1.7.9] - 2026-05-06

### Security

- Resolve transitive moderate XSS advisory **GHSA-v2v4-37r5-5v8g** in `ip-address ≤10.1.0` (reachable via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.26.0` → `express-rate-limit@8.x` → `ip-address`). Added `overrides: { "ip-address": "^10.2.0" }` to `package.json` to force the patched version regardless of upstream re-resolution. `npm audit` now reports `0 vulnerabilities`. CI `security` job (audit gate) was failing on 1.7.8 because of this advisory; this release unblocks it.

---

## [1.7.8] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed (this time properly tested at runtime, MCP attached)

**`add_source` returned `Timeout waiting for source processing` for uploads that actually succeeded — false negative.**

Verified in a live MCP session against my own NotebookLM account. After the upload, `list_content` immediately reported the source as `status: "ready"` while `add_source` reported `success: false`. Root cause traced in `waitForSourceProcessing`: NotebookLM 2026 keeps the upload dialog open after a successful upload (it lets the user chain more uploads), and the count-based success detection in the polling loop was gated behind `if (!dialogVisible)` — so the loop ran for the full 90s timeout while the dialog stayed open, and the early success signal (the source-list count growing by 1) was never tripped. Fix: lift the count-based detection out of the dialog-state branch and run it on every poll cycle. As soon as the source-list count grows, return success regardless of whether NotebookLM has dismissed the dialog or not.

**Packaging: `dist/index.js` and `dist/stdio-http-proxy.js` were published in mode 644 (no executable bit) since at least 1.7.3.**

The shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` was present, but without the executable bit npm-published archives only worked on systems where the npm install step happened to re-chmod (e.g. the `bin` symlink machinery). Sandbox bash environments that don't re-chmod silently failed with `Permission denied`. Fix: new `build:chmod-bin` step in the `build` script that explicitly chmod-755s both binaries before they get tarballed by `npm publish`. Verified locally — `ls -la dist/index.js` now shows `-rwxr-xr-x` after `npm run build`.

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-05-06

### Defensive (not yet validated runtime)

**`add_source` `Could not find "Add source" button` — possibly fixed, definitely better diagnosed.**

Reported by an end-user agent against a freshly-created notebook. Root cause is uncertain without runtime visibility from a Claude Code session — but two things are now in place:

- **Selectors broadened** to cover the empty-notebook layout NotebookLM shows for fresh notebooks (centered "Upload sources" / "Choose files" CTA in EN, "Téléverser" / "Importer" in FR), in addition to the per-panel "+" button. Both aria-label and visible-text variants are tried.
- **Error is now actionable.** Previously the failure surfaced as just `Could not find "Add source" button`. The error now embeds a JSON dump of what the page contains: URL, document title, total button count, and up to 25 buttons with their `aria-label`, text content, mat-icon presence, class list, and visibility flag. Plus the path of the debug screenshot. So when this error reaches the calling agent, it can either pick the right selector itself or paste the dump back to a maintainer for a precise fix.

I do not have runtime access to a NotebookLM session in this environment, so I cannot confirm the broadened selectors actually resolve the error. If the issue persists, the enriched payload is designed to make the next iteration definitive instead of speculative.

---

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

**Two bugs in tools that 1.7.4 exposed without runtime validation. Honest disclosure: I shipped both `create_notebook` and `delete_notebooks_from_nblm` in 1.7.4 without exercising them against a live NotebookLM session — only checked that the handler methods existed and the dispatch was wired. Both had latent issues that surfaced as soon as a real user ran them.**

#### `create_notebook`

Two regressions, both reported by an end-user agent that ran the tool against the live UI:

- The tool returned a transitional URL like `https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/creating/c` instead of the final notebook URL. Root cause: the `waitForURL` regex (`/notebook\//`) matched the transitional URL immediately rather than waiting for the redirect to the UUID-based URL. **Fix:** require a full v4 UUID in the URL pattern, then wait for `networkidle` before reading the URL.
- The `name` parameter was silently ignored — every notebook came back as "Untitled notebook". Root cause: the rename used a generic `[contenteditable="true"], .notebook-title, h1` selector, took the first match (often the wrong element), typed via `Control+a`+`type`, and never verified the result. **Fix:** target ordered, specific selectors (aria-label / placeholder containing "title"/"Untitled"), use `fill` for `<input>` and `evaluate`+keystroke for contenteditable, then **read back the title** to verify the rename took. The tool now returns `name_applied: boolean` and `actual_name: string` so the caller knows whether to retry via the UI.

#### `delete_notebooks_from_nblm`

The handler used `button[aria-labelledby*="project-"]` as its primary selector — the same pattern that broke `list_notebooks_from_nblm` and was rewritten in 1.7.5. So the delete tool was very likely non-functional on the current NotebookLM DOM. **Fix:** locate each notebook tile through its stable `id="project-{UUID}-title"` element (a `page.evaluate()` walks up to the nearest card-like ancestor and stamps it with `data-nblm-target-card`), then resolve the menu button inside that marked card. Same id-pattern strategy that already powers `list_notebooks_from_nblm`.

### Process note

I am updating the project memory to require either a runtime smoke test or a full read of the handler implementation (selectors, `waitForURL`, post-action verification) before exposing any handler as a new MCP tool. Skipping that audit in 1.7.4 cost two extra releases.

---

## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-06

Three bugs reported by an end-user agent against 1.7.2–1.7.4. All three are fixed in this release.

### Fixed

**#1 — `/plugin marketplace update` + `/reload-plugins` did not actually upgrade the running MCP server (cache-poisoning by `npx -y` without a version pin).**

`mcpServers.notebooklm.args` was `["-y", "@roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp"]`. Without a version specifier, `npx` reused the existing `_npx/<hash>/` cache regardless of which version the marketplace just refreshed to. Symptom: plugin manifest showed 1.7.4 but the live MCP server was still 1.7.2 and rejected newly-added tools (`create_notebook` etc.) with `Unknown tool`.

Fix: pin the version inside the args (`"@roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp@1.7.5"`). `scripts/sync-version.mjs` now propagates the package version to both the manifest's `version` field AND the npx pin in `mcpServers.notebooklm.args`. The CI `version:check` validates both. From now on every release ships with a manifest that points npx at exactly the version the marketplace just resolved to.

**#2 — `list_notebooks_from_nblm` returned every notebook with `name: "Notebook"`.**

The Strategy 1 selector (`button[aria-labelledby*="project-"]`) no longer matches the current NotebookLM DOM, so it returned 0. The Strategy 2 fallback then scraped UUIDs out of the raw HTML and **hardcoded `name: 'Notebook'`** for each — making the API report N notebooks all named "Notebook" instead of an empty result or real titles.

Fix: replace the brittle button selector with a DOM-agnostic `page.evaluate()` that walks every element whose `id` matches `project-{UUID}-title` and reads its `textContent`. The id-based naming is intrinsic to NotebookLM's data model and stable across UI rewrites. Strategy 2 (raw HTML fallback) now returns `name: ''` for ids it can only discover from HTML — never the misleading hardcoded placeholder.

**#3 — `get_health.current_account` reported the previous account after `re_auth` succeeded with a different Google account.**

`handleReAuth` ran de-auth + `performSetup()` (manual browser login) but never touched the `current-account.txt` marker. Since `performSetup()` does not know which Google account the user picks during browser login, the marker stayed stale and `get_health` kept returning the old email.

Fix: new `AccountManager.clearCurrentAccountId()` method, called after a successful `re_auth`. `get_health` now truthfully omits `current_account` rather than returning a wrong value. Detecting the new account from the post-login browser state is a richer follow-up — for now we choose honest absence over misleading presence.

---

## [1.7.4] - 2026-05-06

### Added

**Two previously orphaned NotebookLM management tools are now exposed via MCP:**

- `create_notebook({ name?, show_browser? })` — creates a brand-new empty notebook directly in NotebookLM (no pre-existing share URL required, unlike `add_notebook` which only registers an already-created notebook into the local library). Returns the freshly minted `notebook_url` and `notebook_id` so the caller can chain `add_source`, `ask_question`, etc.
- `delete_notebooks_from_nblm({ notebook_ids[], show_browser? })` — bulk-delete notebooks at the NotebookLM UI level (not just from the local library). Returns `{ deleted, failed, message }`. Pair it with `list_notebooks_from_nblm` to discover IDs.

### Internal

Audited the full tool surface: 30 `ToolHandlers` methods are now aligned 1:1 with 30 tool definitions and 30 dispatch cases. No more declared-but-unwired tools, no more handlers without a tool definition.

---

## [1.7.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- `list_notebooks_from_nblm` MCP tool was declared in the tool list but missing from the dispatch switch in `src/index.ts`, so calling it returned `Unknown tool`. Added the missing case → the tool now resolves and runs `handleListNotebooksFromNblm`.

### Known orphans (not fixed in this patch)

- `handleCreateNotebook` and `handleDeleteNotebooksFromNblm` exist as `ToolHandlers` methods but are not exposed via either a tool definition or a switch case. They are unreachable today and have no effect on user-visible behaviour. A follow-up will decide whether to expose them or remove them.

---

## [1.7.2] - 2026-05-06

### Added

**Claude Code plugin manifest + cross-file version sync:**

- New `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the repo root — Claude Code plugin manifest (single source of truth for plugin metadata, including `mcpServers` config). Lets the [`roomi-fields/claude-plugins`](https://github.com/roomi-fields/claude-plugins) aggregated marketplace source this project directly via `source: github` instead of maintaining a duplicated wrapper.
- New `scripts/sync-version.mjs` + npm scripts `version:sync` / `version:check` — propagates `package.json.version` to the plugin manifest, `website/docusaurus.config.ts` (`softwareVersion`), and the README hero line. Uses an in-place regex replace for the plugin manifest so prettier-controlled formatting is preserved across releases (no phantom drift in CI).
- README: new "Option 0 — Claude Code marketplace" Quick Start section pointing at the aggregated marketplace one-liner.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: added a "Verify version sync" step before build/publish — so a release can never ship with a stale plugin manifest or website badge.

### Fixed

- 1.7.1 was tagged but the publish failed when the version-sync check rejected a prettier-induced JSON-formatting drift. This release supersedes that aborted tag.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

**`batch_to_vault` is now a first-class MCP tool — no HTTP server required:**

- New MCP tool `batch_to_vault` exposed alongside `ask_question`, `add_source`, etc. Same parameters and output as the HTTP endpoint (`questions[]`, `vault_dir`, `notebook_id`/`notebook_url`, `slug_prefix`, `source_format`, `sleep_between_ms`, `session_id`). MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex…) can now run a batch directly without starting `npm run start:http` or hitting `localhost:3000`.
- Shared helper `runBatchToVault` in `src/utils/vault-writer.ts` — single source of truth for the batch loop. Both the MCP tool (`ToolHandlers.handleBatchToVault`) and the HTTP `/batch-to-vault` endpoint call it with the same `askQuestion` injection. Eliminates the previous duplicated loop in `http-wrapper.ts`.

### Changed

- `POST /batch-to-vault` is now a thin wrapper over `ToolHandlers.handleBatchToVault`. Behaviour and response shape are unchanged; the implementation is just no longer duplicated.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

**RTFM integration — NotebookLM as one-shot ingestion, RTFM as retrieval layer:**

- `POST /batch-to-vault` endpoint: runs a list of questions and writes each answer as a markdown file (YAML frontmatter + answer + sources block) and a JSON sidecar in a vault directory, ready for ingestion by [RTFM](https://github.com/roomi-fields/rtfm) or any markdown vault tool (Obsidian, Foam, Dendron). Removes the 50-queries/day quota and 10–30s latency for repeat queries on academic / SOTA workflows.
- `src/utils/vault-writer.ts`: `formatAnswerMarkdown`, `formatAnswerJson`, `makeSlug` helpers with NFD-normalised slugs and YAML escape.
- `nblm-answer-v1` JSON Schema published at the canonical, immutable URL [https://schemas.roomi-fields.com/nblm-answer-v1.json](https://schemas.roomi-fields.com/nblm-answer-v1.json) (served as `application/schema+json` with open CORS, JSON-LD Dataset entry for AI-crawler discovery, 24h immutable cache). Source-of-truth copy in `schemas/nblm-answer-v1.json`.
- New documentation page [`14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md`](./deployment/docs/14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md) — full pattern, schema reference, RTFM wiring, recommended layout for academic batches, question-generation prompt.
- README: RTFM listed as the 4th Integration Option alongside MCP, HTTP REST, and Docker.

### Changed

- Root `/` endpoint now lists `batch_to_vault` in its endpoint registry.

---

## [1.5.9] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Restore `mcpName` field in `package.json` (accidentally dropped during the 1.5.8 release). This field is required by the official MCP Registry to verify npm-package ownership; without it the registry refuses to update server metadata. v1.5.9 re-enables registry updates for `io.github.roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp`.

---

## [1.5.8] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

**NotebookLM UI adaptations for 2026 (PR #5 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal):**

- `sanitizeResponseText()`: strip leaked Material-icon labels (`more_vert`, `more_horiz`) and adjacent citation artifacts from answer text
- `ensureDiscussionReady()` / `navigateToDiscussion()`: recover the Discussion panel before asking when the chat composer has been unmounted or disabled
- Count-based source detection: use `.single-source-container` row counts instead of relying on source names, so URL sources (which surface as page titles, not URLs) are still detected correctly
- New UI selectors for the "Add source" flow (`.cdk-overlay-pane`, `role=menu`, `role=menuitem`)
- Chat-input detection now skips visible-but-disabled composers
- Regression tests added in `src/__tests__/{page-utils,browser-session,content-manager}.test.ts`

### Added

**Doctor scripts (PR #6 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal):**

- `npm run doctor:basic` — repo + build artifacts + Node engine check
- `npm run doctor:http` — `/health`, optional `/content` and `/ask` verification (pass `--notebook-url`)
- `.env.example` documenting the project's config knobs

### Security

- Credentials, personal paths, test-account emails, and real notebook UUIDs scrubbed from archived scripts and docs (PR #4 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal and follow-up commits)
- Two tracked debug PNGs with literal Windows paths in their filenames removed from the index

## [1.5.7] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

**Citation Extraction:**

- Fixed `.highlighted` selector: use `.highlighted` class (not `i.highlighted`) for citation excerpt extraction
- Scoped citation button detection to last `.to-user-container .message-text-content` container — fixes multi-question sessions picking up buttons from all previous answers

### Changed

**Docker (PR #1 by @JulienCANTONI):**

- Dockerfile now builds TypeScript from source inside the container instead of copying pre-built `dist/`
- Multi-stage: install all deps → build → prune devDeps → install browser (cleaner CI/CD)
- `.dockerignore` updated to allow `src/` and `tsconfig*.json` for in-container build
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` now supports `PORT` env var (Render PaaS compatibility)

### Security

- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to fix vulnerabilities
- Updated `qs` dependency to fix prototype pollution vulnerability

---

## [1.5.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

**Citation Extraction (Major Rewrite):**

- Rewrote citation excerpt extraction using `page.evaluate()` string expressions — eliminates all `ElementHandle` stale reference errors
- Source names extracted from `span[aria-label]` in a single DOM scan (100% reliable)
- Source excerpts extracted by clicking each citation → reading `i.highlighted` + parent `.paragraph` for full passage context
- Added `Escape` dismiss between each citation click to prevent stale highlight contamination
- Improved from ~50% to **97% success rate** (30/31 citations in real-world test)
- Removed all debug screenshots and verbose logging from production code

**Authentication & Session Recovery:**

- Fixed false "Authenticated" at startup: `verifyWithBrowser()` now does real browser navigation to NotebookLM to check if Google session is truly valid (not just local cookie expiry dates)
- Fixed mid-session `SESSION_EXPIRED`: auto-reauth now uses `AutoLoginManager` with stored credentials (fills email + password automatically), falls back to manual `performSetup()` if needed
- Fixed profile sync direction bug: after `performSetup()`, uses `syncMainToAccount()` (not the reverse) to avoid overwriting fresh auth with stale account cookies
- Fixed `setup-auth --force` flag to bypass cookie check and always open browser

**Port Management:**

- Added `EADDRINUSE` handling: detects ghost processes on port 3000, attempts auto-kill, provides clear error message if port cannot be freed

### Added

**Chrome Profile Auto-Sync:**

- `syncProfileToMain(accountId)`: copies account-specific state/profile → main `chrome_profile/`
- `syncMainToAccount(accountId)`: reverse sync after interactive re-auth
- Both called automatically at the right points in startup and mid-session flows

**Startup Browser Verification (Step 4):**

- New `verifyWithBrowser()` method launches headless browser, navigates to NotebookLM, checks actual URL
- If redirected to `accounts.google.com` → triggers auto-reauth with `AutoLoginManager` (automatic) or `performSetup()` (manual fallback)

---

## [1.5.5] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

**Authentication State Path Mismatch (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `/health` endpoint and session recovery checking wrong path for authentication cookies
- **Root cause:** Multi-account system saves cookies to `accounts/{id}/browser_state/state.json` but code was checking legacy global path `CONFIG.browserStateDir/state.json`
- Fixed in 4 files:
  - `src/startup/startup-manager.ts` - Now uses account-specific state path at startup
  - `src/tools/index.ts` - Health endpoint checks account-specific state with fallback
  - `src/session/shared-context-manager.ts` - Context recreation loads from correct path
  - `src/session/browser-session.ts` - Session recovery uses account-specific state
- All files maintain fallback to legacy AuthManager path for backward compatibility

**Health Endpoint Improvements:**

- Added `current_account` field to health response showing active account email
- Added `accountCheckDone` flag to ensure proper fallback to AuthManager in tests

### Added

**Windows Startup Scripts:**

- `scripts/start-server-hidden.vbs` - VBScript to launch HTTP server silently at Windows startup
- `scripts/stop-server.bat` - Batch script to stop running server processes
- `scripts/mcp-proxy-hidden.ps1` - PowerShell script for hidden window MCP proxy

**Claude Code MCP Integration:**

- Hidden window configuration for MCP stdio proxy in Claude Code projects
- Uses `powershell -WindowStyle Hidden` to avoid shell window popup on each tool call
- Example `.mcp.json` configuration in documentation

---

## [1.5.4] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

**Citation Source Format (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `source_format` parameter not being passed from HTTP `/ask` endpoint to handler
- The parameter was defined in the schema but never extracted from `req.body` in `http-wrapper.ts`
- All source formats now work correctly: `none`, `inline`, `footnotes`, `json`, `expanded`

**Citation Extraction:**

- Updated `CITATION_SELECTORS` for current NotebookLM DOM (January 2026):
  - Primary: `button.citation-marker`, `button.xap-inline-dialog.citation-marker`
  - Fallback selectors for backwards compatibility
- Updated `TOOLTIP_SELECTORS` for source text extraction:
  - Primary: `i.highlighted`, `.paragraph i.highlighted`
- New `extractSourceFromElement()` function extracts both:
  - `sourceName`: from `aria-label` attribute (e.g., "17: Filename.pdf")
  - `sourceText`: from hover tooltip content

**Docker/noVNC:**

- Fixed Xvfb startup error: `_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0`
- Added `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory creation with proper permissions (1777) in Dockerfile
- Changed exposed port from 5900 (raw VNC) to 6080 (noVNC web interface) in docker-compose.yml

### Added

- E2E tests for `source_format` parameter: `[T15]`, `[T16]`, `[T17]` in `tests/e2e/tests/03-ask.test.ts`

**New Configuration Options:**

- `browserChannel` config: `chromium` (default) or `chrome`
- `ENABLE_VNC` environment variable for Docker
- `NOVNC_PORT` environment variable (default: 6080)

### Fixed

**Docker Compatibility:**

- Fixed locale configuration to use `CONFIG.uiLocale` instead of hardcoded `en-US`
- Fixed browser channel for Docker (chromium vs chrome)
- Fixed patchright browser installation in Dockerfile
- Fixed `show_browser` parameter passing to `performSetup`

---

## [1.3.3] - 2025-01-26

### Security

**CORS Hardening:**

- Added CORS whitelist configuration via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Default whitelist allows only localhost origins (ports 3000, 5678, 8080)
- Blocked external origins no longer receive CORS headers
- Supports wildcard `*` for development when explicitly configured

**Input Validation:**

- Added Zod schema validation for all HTTP endpoints
- Validates request bodies with detailed error messages
- Schemas: AskQuestionSchema, AddNotebookSchema, UpdateNotebookSchema, AutoDiscoverSchema, CleanupDataSchema, ShowBrowserSchema

**Express Route Security:**

- Prevents route hijacking vulnerabilities

### Fixed

**Error Handling:**

- Replaced 30+ empty catch blocks with proper `log.debug()` logging
- Improved error visibility for debugging without breaking functionality

**Type Safety:**

- Refactored `ToolResult<T>` to discriminated union type for compile-time safety
- Fixed `ServerState` types with proper `Browser`, `SessionManager`, `AuthManager` types
- Added `JSONSchemaProperty` type for MCP tool input schemas
- Added config validation with constraint checking (min/max ranges, positive values)

- Fixed `test-errors.ps1` pattern matching for Zod validation messages

---

## [1.3.2] - 2025-01-24

### Added

**Authentication Management:**

- New MCP tool `de_auth` for secure logout (clears all credentials without re-authenticating)
- Separation of concerns: `de_auth` (logout only), `re_auth` (logout + re-authenticate), `setup_auth` (first-time)
- HTTP API endpoints for complete authentication lifecycle:
  - `POST /de-auth` - Logout and clear credentials
  - `POST /re-auth` - Re-authenticate with different account
  - `POST /cleanup-data` - Clean all data (requires confirmation)

**HTTP API Feature Parity:**

- Added 7 missing endpoints to achieve 100% parity with MCP stdio tools
- Authentication: `/de-auth`, `/re-auth`, `/cleanup-data`
- Notebooks: `PUT /notebooks/:id`, `/notebooks/search`, `/notebooks/stats`
- Sessions: `POST /sessions/:id/reset`
- All 22 endpoints now available via both HTTP REST API and MCP stdio

**Documentation:**

- Complete API reference updated with all 22 endpoints in `deployment/docs/03-API.md`
- Added curl examples and request/response schemas for all new endpoints
- Categorized endpoints by type (Authentication, Queries, Notebooks, Sessions)

- Added check for existing auth before clearing credentials
- Users can now switch between HTTP and MCP stdio modes without re-authenticating
- Preserves user experience when switching interfaces

**Code Quality:**

- Refactored `re_auth` to use `de_auth` internally (DRY principle)
- Improved separation of concerns in authentication flow
- Better error handling in HTTP wrapper

### Changed

**Version Synchronization:**

- Updated all version references across codebase to 1.3.2
- Synchronized versions in package.json, src/index.ts, src/http-wrapper.ts, README.md
- Consistent versioning across all documentation files

---

- Updated feature descriptions to mention MCP auto-discovery availability

### Known Issues

**Chrome Profile Locking:**

- HTTP server and MCP stdio modes cannot run simultaneously
- Both modes use same Chrome profile, causing "resource busy" errors
- **Workaround:** Choose one mode at a time, or stop HTTP daemon before using Claude Desktop
- **Fix planned:** v1.4.0 will use separate Chrome profiles automatically

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-23

- **Solution:** Added a 5-second delay before closing Chrome
- **File:** `src/auth/auth-manager.ts` line 966
- **Impact:** Persistent authentication now works on Windows

**Bug - Streaming Detection:**

- **Issue:** Truncated responses or placeholders returned ("Getting the context...")
- **Cause:** Stability threshold too low (3 polls) and missing NotebookLM placeholders
- **Solution:**
  - Added NotebookLM placeholders ("getting the context", "loading", "please wait")
  - Increased stability threshold to 8 polls (~8 seconds)
- **File:** `src/utils/page-utils.ts` lines 51-53 and 210
- **Impact:** Complete and reliable responses (tested up to 5964 characters)
