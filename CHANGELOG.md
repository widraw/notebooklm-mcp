## [1.7.2] - 2026-05-06

### Added

**Claude Code plugin manifest + cross-file version sync:**

- New `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the repo root — Claude Code plugin manifest (single source of truth for plugin metadata, including `mcpServers` config). Lets the [`roomi-fields/claude-plugins`](https://github.com/roomi-fields/claude-plugins) aggregated marketplace source this project directly via `source: github` instead of maintaining a duplicated wrapper.
- New `scripts/sync-version.mjs` + npm scripts `version:sync` / `version:check` — propagates `package.json.version` to the plugin manifest, `website/docusaurus.config.ts` (`softwareVersion`), and the README hero line. Uses an in-place regex replace for the plugin manifest so prettier-controlled formatting is preserved across releases (no phantom drift in CI).
- README: new "Option 0 — Claude Code marketplace" Quick Start section pointing at the aggregated marketplace one-liner.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: added a "Verify version sync" step before build/publish — so a release can never ship with a stale plugin manifest or website badge.

### Fixed

- 1.7.1 was tagged but the publish failed when the version-sync check rejected a prettier-induced JSON-formatting drift. This release supersedes that aborted tag.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

**`batch_to_vault` is now a first-class MCP tool — no HTTP server required:**

- New MCP tool `batch_to_vault` exposed alongside `ask_question`, `add_source`, etc. Same parameters and output as the HTTP endpoint (`questions[]`, `vault_dir`, `notebook_id`/`notebook_url`, `slug_prefix`, `source_format`, `sleep_between_ms`, `session_id`). MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex…) can now run a batch directly without starting `npm run start:http` or hitting `localhost:3000`.
- Shared helper `runBatchToVault` in `src/utils/vault-writer.ts` — single source of truth for the batch loop. Both the MCP tool (`ToolHandlers.handleBatchToVault`) and the HTTP `/batch-to-vault` endpoint call it with the same `askQuestion` injection. Eliminates the previous duplicated loop in `http-wrapper.ts`.

### Changed

- `POST /batch-to-vault` is now a thin wrapper over `ToolHandlers.handleBatchToVault`. Behaviour and response shape are unchanged; the implementation is just no longer duplicated.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

**RTFM integration — NotebookLM as one-shot ingestion, RTFM as retrieval layer:**

- `POST /batch-to-vault` endpoint: runs a list of questions and writes each answer as a markdown file (YAML frontmatter + answer + sources block) and a JSON sidecar in a vault directory, ready for ingestion by [RTFM](https://github.com/roomi-fields/rtfm) or any markdown vault tool (Obsidian, Foam, Dendron). Removes the 50-queries/day quota and 10–30s latency for repeat queries on academic / SOTA workflows.
- `src/utils/vault-writer.ts`: `formatAnswerMarkdown`, `formatAnswerJson`, `makeSlug` helpers with NFD-normalised slugs and YAML escape.
- `nblm-answer-v1` JSON Schema published at the canonical, immutable URL [https://schemas.roomi-fields.com/nblm-answer-v1.json](https://schemas.roomi-fields.com/nblm-answer-v1.json) (served as `application/schema+json` with open CORS, JSON-LD Dataset entry for AI-crawler discovery, 24h immutable cache). Source-of-truth copy in `schemas/nblm-answer-v1.json`.
- New documentation page [`14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md`](./deployment/docs/14-RTFM-INTEGRATION.md) — full pattern, schema reference, RTFM wiring, recommended layout for academic batches, question-generation prompt.
- README: RTFM listed as the 4th Integration Option alongside MCP, HTTP REST, and Docker.

### Changed

- Root `/` endpoint now lists `batch_to_vault` in its endpoint registry.

---

## [1.5.9] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- Restore `mcpName` field in `package.json` (accidentally dropped during the 1.5.8 release). This field is required by the official MCP Registry to verify npm-package ownership; without it the registry refuses to update server metadata. v1.5.9 re-enables registry updates for `io.github.roomi-fields/notebooklm-mcp`.

---

## [1.5.8] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

**NotebookLM UI adaptations for 2026 (PR #5 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal):**

- `sanitizeResponseText()`: strip leaked Material-icon labels (`more_vert`, `more_horiz`) and adjacent citation artifacts from answer text
- `ensureDiscussionReady()` / `navigateToDiscussion()`: recover the Discussion panel before asking when the chat composer has been unmounted or disabled
- Count-based source detection: use `.single-source-container` row counts instead of relying on source names, so URL sources (which surface as page titles, not URLs) are still detected correctly
- New UI selectors for the "Add source" flow (`.cdk-overlay-pane`, `role=menu`, `role=menuitem`)
- Chat-input detection now skips visible-but-disabled composers
- Regression tests added in `src/__tests__/{page-utils,browser-session,content-manager}.test.ts`

### Added

**Doctor scripts (PR #6 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal):**

- `npm run doctor:basic` — repo + build artifacts + Node engine check
- `npm run doctor:http` — `/health`, optional `/content` and `/ask` verification (pass `--notebook-url`)
- `.env.example` documenting the project's config knobs

### Security

- Credentials, personal paths, test-account emails, and real notebook UUIDs scrubbed from archived scripts and docs (PR #4 by @KhizarJamshaidIqbal and follow-up commits)
- Two tracked debug PNGs with literal Windows paths in their filenames removed from the index
- `npm audit fix` applied: hono 4.12.14, @hono/node-server 1.19.14, express-rate-limit 8.3.2, handlebars 4.7.9, brace-expansion, flatted, ip-address bumped to patched versions (no direct-dependency changes)

---

## [1.5.7] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

**Citation Extraction:**

- Fixed `.highlighted` selector: use `.highlighted` class (not `i.highlighted`) for citation excerpt extraction
- Scoped citation button detection to last `.to-user-container .message-text-content` container — fixes multi-question sessions picking up buttons from all previous answers

### Changed

**Docker (PR #1 by @JulienCANTONI):**

- Dockerfile now builds TypeScript from source inside the container instead of copying pre-built `dist/`
- Multi-stage: install all deps → build → prune devDeps → install browser (cleaner CI/CD)
- `.dockerignore` updated to allow `src/` and `tsconfig*.json` for in-container build
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` now supports `PORT` env var (Render PaaS compatibility)

### Security

- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to fix vulnerabilities
- Updated `qs` dependency to fix prototype pollution vulnerability

---

## [1.5.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

**Citation Extraction (Major Rewrite):**

- Rewrote citation excerpt extraction using `page.evaluate()` string expressions — eliminates all `ElementHandle` stale reference errors
- Source names extracted from `span[aria-label]` in a single DOM scan (100% reliable)
- Source excerpts extracted by clicking each citation → reading `i.highlighted` + parent `.paragraph` for full passage context
- Added `Escape` dismiss between each citation click to prevent stale highlight contamination
- Improved from ~50% to **97% success rate** (30/31 citations in real-world test)
- Removed all debug screenshots and verbose logging from production code

**Authentication & Session Recovery:**

- Fixed false "Authenticated" at startup: `verifyWithBrowser()` now does real browser navigation to NotebookLM to check if Google session is truly valid (not just local cookie expiry dates)
- Fixed mid-session `SESSION_EXPIRED`: auto-reauth now uses `AutoLoginManager` with stored credentials (fills email + password automatically), falls back to manual `performSetup()` if needed
- Fixed profile sync direction bug: after `performSetup()`, uses `syncMainToAccount()` (not the reverse) to avoid overwriting fresh auth with stale account cookies
- Fixed `setup-auth --force` flag to bypass cookie check and always open browser

**Port Management:**

- Added `EADDRINUSE` handling: detects ghost processes on port 3000, attempts auto-kill, provides clear error message if port cannot be freed

### Added

**Chrome Profile Auto-Sync:**

- `syncProfileToMain(accountId)`: copies account-specific state/profile → main `chrome_profile/`
- `syncMainToAccount(accountId)`: reverse sync after interactive re-auth
- Both called automatically at the right points in startup and mid-session flows

**Startup Browser Verification (Step 4):**

- New `verifyWithBrowser()` method launches headless browser, navigates to NotebookLM, checks actual URL
- If redirected to `accounts.google.com` → triggers auto-reauth with `AutoLoginManager` (automatic) or `performSetup()` (manual fallback)

---

## [1.5.5] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

**Authentication State Path Mismatch (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `/health` endpoint and session recovery checking wrong path for authentication cookies
- **Root cause:** Multi-account system saves cookies to `accounts/{id}/browser_state/state.json` but code was checking legacy global path `CONFIG.browserStateDir/state.json`
- Fixed in 4 files:
  - `src/startup/startup-manager.ts` - Now uses account-specific state path at startup
  - `src/tools/index.ts` - Health endpoint checks account-specific state with fallback
  - `src/session/shared-context-manager.ts` - Context recreation loads from correct path
  - `src/session/browser-session.ts` - Session recovery uses account-specific state
- All files maintain fallback to legacy AuthManager path for backward compatibility

**Health Endpoint Improvements:**

- Added `current_account` field to health response showing active account email
- Added `accountCheckDone` flag to ensure proper fallback to AuthManager in tests

### Added

**Windows Startup Scripts:**

- `scripts/start-server-hidden.vbs` - VBScript to launch HTTP server silently at Windows startup
- `scripts/stop-server.bat` - Batch script to stop running server processes
- `scripts/mcp-proxy-hidden.ps1` - PowerShell script for hidden window MCP proxy

**Claude Code MCP Integration:**

- Hidden window configuration for MCP stdio proxy in Claude Code projects
- Uses `powershell -WindowStyle Hidden` to avoid shell window popup on each tool call
- Example `.mcp.json` configuration in documentation

---

## [1.5.4] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

**Citation Source Format (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `source_format` parameter not being passed from HTTP `/ask` endpoint to handler
- The parameter was defined in the schema but never extracted from `req.body` in `http-wrapper.ts`
- All source formats now work correctly: `none`, `inline`, `footnotes`, `json`, `expanded`

**Citation Extraction:**

- Updated `CITATION_SELECTORS` for current NotebookLM DOM (January 2026):
  - Primary: `button.citation-marker`, `button.xap-inline-dialog.citation-marker`
  - Fallback selectors for backwards compatibility
- Updated `TOOLTIP_SELECTORS` for source text extraction:
  - Primary: `i.highlighted`, `.paragraph i.highlighted`
- New `extractSourceFromElement()` function extracts both:
  - `sourceName`: from `aria-label` attribute (e.g., "17: Filename.pdf")
  - `sourceText`: from hover tooltip content

**Docker/noVNC:**

- Fixed Xvfb startup error: `_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0`
- Added `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory creation with proper permissions (1777) in Dockerfile
- Changed exposed port from 5900 (raw VNC) to 6080 (noVNC web interface) in docker-compose.yml

### Added

- E2E tests for `source_format` parameter: `[T15]`, `[T16]`, `[T17]` in `tests/e2e/tests/03-ask.test.ts`

**New Configuration Options:**

- `browserChannel` config: `chromium` (default) or `chrome`
- `ENABLE_VNC` environment variable for Docker
- `NOVNC_PORT` environment variable (default: 6080)

### Fixed

**Docker Compatibility:**

- Fixed locale configuration to use `CONFIG.uiLocale` instead of hardcoded `en-US`
- Fixed browser channel for Docker (chromium vs chrome)
- Fixed patchright browser installation in Dockerfile
- Fixed `show_browser` parameter passing to `performSetup`

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-29

### Removed

**Fake Content Generation Features:**

- Removed `generate_content` endpoint for FAQ, Study Guide, Briefing Doc, Timeline, and Table of Contents
- These features were NOT real NotebookLM integrations - they were just sending prompts to the chat

**What was fake:**

- `briefing_doc` - Was just asking NotebookLM chat to generate a summary
- `study_guide` - Was just asking NotebookLM chat to create study materials
- `faq` - Was just asking NotebookLM chat to generate FAQs
- `timeline` - Was just asking NotebookLM chat to create a timeline
- `table_of_contents` - Was just asking NotebookLM chat to create a TOC

**What is real:**

- Audio Overview generation - Uses NotebookLM's actual podcast feature
- Audio download - Downloads the real generated audio file
- Q&A with citations - Uses NotebookLM's actual chat with source citations
- Source management - Uses NotebookLM's actual source upload features

---

- Removed strict type validation tests that were testing unimplemented server-side validation

---

## [1.3.3] - 2025-01-26

### Security

**CORS Hardening:**

- Added CORS whitelist configuration via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Default whitelist allows only localhost origins (ports 3000, 5678, 8080)
- Blocked external origins no longer receive CORS headers
- Supports wildcard `*` for development when explicitly configured

**Input Validation:**

- Added Zod schema validation for all HTTP endpoints
- Validates request bodies with detailed error messages
- Schemas: AskQuestionSchema, AddNotebookSchema, UpdateNotebookSchema, AutoDiscoverSchema, CleanupDataSchema, ShowBrowserSchema

- Prevents route hijacking vulnerabilities

### Fixed

**Error Handling:**

- Replaced 30+ empty catch blocks with proper `log.debug()` logging
- Improved error visibility for debugging without breaking functionality

**Type Safety:**

- Refactored `ToolResult<T>` to discriminated union type for compile-time safety
- Fixed `ServerState` types with proper `Browser`, `SessionManager`, `AuthManager` types
- Added `JSONSchemaProperty` type for MCP tool input schemas
- Added config validation with constraint checking (min/max ranges, positive values)

- Fixed `test-errors.ps1` pattern matching for Zod validation messages

---

## [1.3.2] - 2025-01-24

### Added

**Authentication Management:**

- New MCP tool `de_auth` for secure logout (clears all credentials without re-authenticating)
- Separation of concerns: `de_auth` (logout only), `re_auth` (logout + re-authenticate), `setup_auth` (first-time)
- HTTP API endpoints for complete authentication lifecycle:
  - `POST /de-auth` - Logout and clear credentials
  - `POST /re-auth` - Re-authenticate with different account
  - `POST /cleanup-data` - Clean all data (requires confirmation)

**HTTP API Feature Parity:**

- Added 7 missing endpoints to achieve 100% parity with MCP stdio tools
- Authentication: `/de-auth`, `/re-auth`, `/cleanup-data`
- Notebooks: `PUT /notebooks/:id`, `/notebooks/search`, `/notebooks/stats`
- Sessions: `POST /sessions/:id/reset`
- All 22 endpoints now available via both HTTP REST API and MCP stdio

**Documentation:**

- Complete API reference updated with all 22 endpoints in `deployment/docs/03-API.md`
- Added curl examples and request/response schemas for all new endpoints
- Categorized endpoints by type (Authentication, Queries, Notebooks, Sessions)

### Fixed

**Authentication Preservation:**

- Critical fix: `setup_auth` no longer erases existing authentication
- Added check for existing auth before clearing credentials
- Users can now switch between HTTP and MCP stdio modes without re-authenticating
- Preserves user experience when switching interfaces

**Code Quality:**

- Refactored `re_auth` to use `de_auth` internally (DRY principle)
- Improved separation of concerns in authentication flow
- Better error handling in HTTP wrapper

### Changed

**Version Synchronization:**

- Updated all version references across codebase to 1.3.2
- Synchronized versions in package.json, src/index.ts, src/http-wrapper.ts, README.md
- Consistent versioning across all documentation files

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-24

### Added

**MCP Auto-Discovery Tool:**

- New MCP tool `auto_discover_notebook` for Claude Desktop/Cursor integration
- Automatically generates notebook metadata via NotebookLM (30 seconds vs 5 minutes)
- Zero-friction notebook addition: just provide URL, metadata is auto-generated
- Parity with HTTP API: MCP clients now have same auto-discovery capability

**Documentation:**

- Added `docs/CHROME_PROFILE_LIMITATION.md` documenting Chrome profile conflict
- Documented current limitation: HTTP and MCP stdio modes cannot run simultaneously
- Added roadmap for v1.4.0: Separate Chrome profiles by mode

### Fixed

**Critical Compatibility Fix:**

- Disabled `CompleteRequestSchema` handler causing crashes with Claude Desktop
- Fixed: "Server does not support completions" error on connection
- Claude Desktop now connects successfully without modifications

### Changed

**Tool Documentation:**

- Updated `add_notebook` tool to recommend `auto_discover_notebook` first
- Clarified when to use manual entry vs auto-discovery
- Added fallback workflow if auto-discovery fails

**README Updates:**

- Added warning about HTTP/stdio mode conflict (temporary until v1.4.0)
- Added Chrome profile limitation to roadmap as priority feature
- Updated feature descriptions to mention MCP auto-discovery availability

### Known Issues

**Chrome Profile Locking:**

- HTTP server and MCP stdio modes cannot run simultaneously
- Both modes use same Chrome profile, causing "resource busy" errors
- **Workaround:** Choose one mode at a time, or stop HTTP daemon before using Claude Desktop
- **Fix planned:** v1.4.0 will use separate Chrome profiles automatically

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-23

### Fixed

**Critical Bug - Windows Authentication:**

- **Issue:** chrome_profile/ remained empty after Google authentication
- **Cause:** Windows filesystem does not immediately flush writes
- **Solution:** Added a 5-second delay before closing Chrome
- **File:** `src/auth/auth-manager.ts` line 966
- **Impact:** Persistent authentication now works on Windows

**Bug - Streaming Detection:**

- **Issue:** Truncated responses or placeholders returned ("Getting the context...")
- **Cause:** Stability threshold too low (3 polls) and missing NotebookLM placeholders
- **Solution:**
  - Added NotebookLM placeholders ("getting the context", "loading", "please wait")
  - Increased stability threshold to 8 polls (~8 seconds)
- **File:** `src/utils/page-utils.ts` lines 51-53 and 210
- **Impact:** Complete and reliable responses (tested up to 5964 characters)

**Bug - System Text in Responses:**

- **Issue:** Each response contained "\n\nEXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need..."
- **Cause:** `FOLLOW_UP_REMINDER` constant added after text cleanup
- **Solution:** Removed the constant and its usage
- **File:** `src/tools/index.ts` lines 30-31 and 791
- **Impact:** Clean responses, only NotebookLM content

### Changed

**Configuration:**

- `.env` support with dotenv (optional)
- Sane defaults: `HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `HTTP_PORT=3000`, `HEADLESS=true`
